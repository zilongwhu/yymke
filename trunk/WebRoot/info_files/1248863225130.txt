            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></span><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: '宋体';">Electromagnetic stirrer employs low frequency power-supply integrated with international successful experience of conversion technology and latest digital circuit chip generated SPWM wave, and closed loop incremental control feedback system, featuring high stability of output waveform, output current shifting range less than or equal to 0.5%.<br />
            <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Low frequency power-supply was alternating conversion technology and its rectification section has huge cpacity for filtration and power factor compensation. The power factor is 0.9.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Control section is digital&nbsp;controlled with high precision of given output data featuring high stability and reliability. Its output current can be monitored with nine tests of 3-phase unbalanced, over voltage, under voltage and etc.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Contravariant during section uses IBM intelligent power module, featuring high frequency switching, less consumption switching, and low operating temperature(10C higher than the environment temperature).</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The power module has 4 protection functions. Its stability and reliability is superior to apparatus using IGBT.GTR.<br />
            <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>3-phase sine wave pulse-width modulating frequency can be set up to max. 2500Hz high carrier frequency, high output current, less secondary harmonic wave and ideal &amp; smooth sine wave, which ensure the stirring effect and prolong the stirring service life.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The leakage current detector will ensure the system body operating under controlled and safety of the system and contravariant power-supply cabinet.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The detector will alarm when leakage current is more than 4A and auto stop when leakage current is more than 8A.<br />
            <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Low frequency power-supply output is adjustable to meet (current on 1000A adjustable, frequency 0.5-25Hz adjustable) the different stirring strength for various steels.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Circuit board uses pull-in type mental encosure with interfere shielded and has error display array indicators to serve convenient monitoring and maintenance.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Electrical controller uses imported components, contravariant module, conmmutating bridge module, DCDC module are Mitsubishi products; contactor and circuit breaker use Simens product series; capacitor, digital chipm transistor and other electronic parts are from Hitache product series.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>All components haue passed the strict quality testing and transistor and circuit board have been done high temperature tempering, which ensure the reliability and stability of the electrical controller.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>The low frequency power-supply system of the electromagnetic stirrer is operated by industrial controlling computer or monolithic controlling computer, which uses micro synchronous mode inside and has accesible interface with all kinds of communications( hard communication and soft communication) from the center control chamber of the customer outside so that the remote operation produces can be done by the common control panel, industrial controlling computer or superior level industrial controlling computer.</span><br />
            <span style="font-family: '宋体';"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>We specially designed and produced high power purifying power source using special anti-disturbance device based on commutating power compensation and contravariant circuit distribution. Anti-disturbance measurements have been taken for the application of components and control software to ensure the module will not be burnt down during the operation of the equipment. This is the major advantage of our products different from other apparatus at home and abroad.</span></span></p>
