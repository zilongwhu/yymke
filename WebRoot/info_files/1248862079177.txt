            General Description</span></strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 18px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">The application of electromagnetic stirring in the conti-casting production sprung up furing the middle and late period of 1980s. So far our country has about 5,000 units of conti-casting machine in all. More than 1,000 of them have been equipped with electromagnetic stirrer. Through production practice, it's successively proved that the technology of electromagnetic stirring is effective in improving the quality of throwing speed and relaxing the operation restrictions. So, this kind of technology has been developed soon and is popular with most steel mills.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our technicians have more than 20 years' experience on the research, design and manufacturing of the conti-casting electromagnetic stirring equipment. Their achievement was awarded the 'Great Research Achievement' by Metallurgy Department in 1985, and was in the leading to get the patent right named&lt;conti-casting electromagnetic stirring equipment&gt;(Patent No.87104014X). Then the technology was approved and issued as 85 Promoting Program of National Science &amp; Research Achievements'(total 12 items in Metallurgy Department). In 1996, it was awarded the 'Science &amp; Technology Star of Invention' by TIPS system of the United Nations.</span></p>
            <p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Operation Principle</span></strong></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 14px;">The working priciple of electromagnetic stirrer is similar to the asynchronous electric motor of solid rotator. The main body of the stirrer is like a stator, and the cast billet liquid core is like a rotator. The active magnetic field generated by the stirrer acts on the steel liquid inside the casting billet, and then makes that the steel liquid run by the set direction and speed, the columnar crystal for freezing head being broken up, improve the efficiency of condensation heat transfer, and enlarge the area of quiaxed grain and reduce or remove the crack, blister, pin hole, big article of impurity, central segregation and etc.</span></p>
