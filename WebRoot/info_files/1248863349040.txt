            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 14px;">The permanent magnetic lifter is composed of permanent magnetic disk and unloading equipment. The permanent magnetic disk is made up by permanent magnetic part and magnetic conductive plate. The magnetic line of force generated by the permanent magnetic part goes through the magnetic conductive plate, and the materials attracted, then form a close circuit to achieve the purpose of attracting materials. It has the characteristics of big attraction force, small volume, light weight, high energy-saving, reliable operation and long service life. The main specification norms are higher than the national standards. This product is widely used in mechanic manufacturing, shipyard, auto manufacturing factory, dock, stock field(especially the rivet welding, steel structural piece, digital machine tool unloading and etc.), and situations for handling steel plate &amp; round steel.</span></td>
