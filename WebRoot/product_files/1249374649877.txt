<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px;"> Double coil electromagnetic stirrer has two individual stirring devices: one is installed on the bottom position of the crystallizer as the main stirrer; another is installed on the meniscus section of the crystallizer as auxiliary stirrer. Each stirrer has its own power-supply and can generate individual magnetic field (strength and direction can be controlled).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rotation direction of the magnetic field of the auxiliary stirrer can be opposite to that of the main stirrer as well as the same upon requirements of immersion type or open type pouring. Wheb the rotaion direction of the magnet field is reversed, the auxiliary stirrer acts as a brake so as to minimize the electromagnetic stirring intensity on the meniscus section. When the rotation direction of the magnetic field of the auxiliary stirrer and the main stirrer keep the same, the magnetic field will be added up to strengthen the electromagnetic stirring intensity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The serial products according to the pouring requirements, the stirring intensity on the meniscus section can be contedled as 0~1.4 times of the main stirrer. Other kinds of electromagnetic can't realize such flexibilities can be made exteriorized </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">or built-in type.</span></p>
